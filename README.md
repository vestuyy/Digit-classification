# Project Overview 

# 1. Prepare the data and environment 

### 1.1. Check the device and import modules 

```python
import torch

# Import the torch library, which is a popular deep learning framework

# Device configuration
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
# Check if a CUDA-enabled GPU is available using torch.cuda.is_available()
# If GPU is available, set device to 'cuda' to run code on GPU
# If GPU is not available, set device to 'cpu' to run code on CPU

# Print the selected device ('cuda' or 'cpu')
print(device)

# Import the necessary modules
# Import the datasets module from torchvision library
# The torchvision library provides popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR10, etc.
# These datasets can be used for computer vision tasks
from torchvision import datasets

# Import the ToTensor class from the transforms module in torchvision
# The ToTensor transform is used to convert input data, such as images, into PyTorch tensors
# It ensures that the data is in the appropriate format for deep learning tasks
from torchvision.transforms import ToTensor
```

By importing these modules and using the provided functionalities:

The datasets module allows you to work with pre-built datasets like MNIST, CIFAR10, etc., which are commonly used in computer vision tasks.
The ToTensor class from the transforms module allows you to convert data, such as images, into PyTorch tensors, which is the appropriate format for deep learning models.
These imports enable you to load and process datasets, as well as convert the data into a suitable format for training and inference with deep learning models.

### 1.2. Get the dataset  
```python
# Import the necessary modules
from torchvision import datasets
from torchvision.transforms import ToTensor

# Download the MNIST training dataset
train_data = datasets.MNIST(
    root='data',              # Root directory where the dataset will be stored
    train=True,               # Download the training split of the dataset
    transform=ToTensor(),     # Convert the image to a PyTorch tensor
    download=True,            # Download the dataset if it doesn't exist
)

# Download the MNIST test dataset
test_data = datasets.MNIST(
    root='data',              # Root directory where the dataset will be stored
    train=False,              # Download the test split of the dataset
    transform=ToTensor(),     # Convert the image to a PyTorch tensor
)

# Print information about the training dataset
print(train_data)
print(train_data.data.size())       # Size/shape of the input images
print(train_data.targets.size())    # Number of labels in the training dataset
```


1. `datasets.MNIST`: This is a class provided by the torchvision library that represents the MNIST dataset. It allows you to download and work with the MNIST dataset conveniently. When creating an instance of this class, you can pass various parameters to customize its behavior. In the code, `datasets.MNIST()` is used to create instances for both the training and test datasets.

2. `root`: This parameter specifies the root directory where the downloaded dataset will be stored. In the code, `'data'` is used as the root directory. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created.

3. `train`: This parameter determines whether to download the training split of the dataset. By setting it to `True`, the code downloads the training data. When set to `False`, it downloads the test data.

4. `transform`: This parameter allows you to specify any transformations that should be applied to the dataset. In the code, `ToTensor()` is used, which converts the input images from the dataset into PyTorch tensors. This transformation is necessary because most deep learning frameworks, including PyTorch, work with tensors as the input data format.

5. `download`: This parameter specifies whether to download the dataset if it doesn't already exist. By setting it to `True`, the code will download the dataset. If the dataset is already present in the specified `root` directory, it will not be re-downloaded.

6. `train_data.data`: This attribute of the `MNIST` dataset object represents the input images in the training dataset. It contains the pixel values of the images.

7. `train_data.targets`: This attribute represents the labels corresponding to the input images in the training dataset. It contains the ground-truth values for each image.

8. `size()`: This is a method available for PyTorch tensors. It returns the size or shape of a tensor. In the code, `train_data.data.size()` is used to get the size of the input images tensor, and `train_data.targets.size()` is used to get the size of the labels tensor.

By using the `datasets.MNIST` class and these functions, you can conveniently download the MNIST dataset and access its images and labels for further processing or training machine learning models.

### 1.3. Visualization (Optional)   
```python
# Visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Import the matplotlib.pyplot module for visualization purposes

plt.imshow(train_data.data[0], cmap='gray')
# Display the image at index 0 from the train_data dataset using imshow()
# The cmap='gray' argument specifies that the image should be displayed in grayscale

plt.title('%i' % train_data.targets[0])
# Set the title of the plot to the label/target corresponding to the image at index 0
# The '%i' is a placeholder that will be replaced by the value of train_data.targets[0]

plt.show()
# Display the plot

```




### 1.4. Preparing data for training with DataLoaders
   
```python
# Preparing the data for training
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Import the DataLoader class from torch.utils.data module
# The DataLoader class provides an iterable over a dataset for batching and parallel loading

# The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) data consists of 60,000 training images
# and 10,000 test images. Each image is a crude 28 x 28 (784 pixels) handwritten digit from "0" to "9."
# Each pixel value is a grayscale integer between 0 and 255.

batch_size = 100
# Set the batch size for training and testing data
# A batch is a subset of the dataset that is processed together during training or inference

loaders = {
    'train': torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_data,
                                         batch_size=batch_size,
                                         shuffle=True,
                                         num_workers=1),
    # Create a DataLoader object named 'train' for the training data
    # Pass the 'train_data' dataset to the DataLoader
    # Set the batch size using the 'batch_size' variable
    # Set shuffle=True to randomize the order of the data during training
    # Set num_workers=1 to use a single worker for loading the data

    'test': torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_data,
                                        batch_size=batch_size,
                                        shuffle=True,
                                        num_workers=1),
    # Create a DataLoader object named 'test' for the testing data
    # Pass the 'test_data' dataset to the DataLoader
    # Set the batch size using the 'batch_size' variable
    # Set shuffle=True to randomize the order of the data during testing
    # Set num_workers=1 to use a single worker for loading the data
}

```

This code segment performs the following steps:

1. Imports the `DataLoader` class from the `torch.utils.data` module. The `DataLoader` class provides an iterable over a dataset for batching and parallel loading.

2. Sets the `batch_size` to 100. This defines the number of samples that will be processed together as a batch during training or testing.

3. Creates a dictionary named `loaders` to store the DataLoader objects.

4. Creates a DataLoader object named `'train'` for the training data. It uses the `train_data` dataset as input and configures the DataLoader with the specified `batch_size`, `shuffle=True` (to shuffle the data during training), and `num_workers=1` (to use a single worker for loading the data).

5. Creates a DataLoader object named `'test'` for the testing data. It uses the `test_data` dataset as input and configures the DataLoader with the specified `batch_size`, `shuffle=True` (to shuffle the data during testing), and `num_workers=1` (to use a single worker for loading the data).

By using the DataLoader objects created in this code, you can conveniently iterate over the training and testing data in batches during the training and testing phases of your model.


## 2. Define the Convolutional Neural Network model

```python
import torch.nn as nn

# Import the nn module from torch to define neural network models

class CNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CNN, self).__init__()
        # Define the CNN model by inheriting from the nn.Module class

        self.conv1 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(
                in_channels=1,
                out_channels=16,
                kernel_size=5,
                stride=1,
                padding=2,
            ),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2),
        )
        # Define the first convolutional layer (conv1) using nn.Sequential
        # nn.Conv2d creates a 2D convolutional layer
        # in_channels=1 specifies that the input has 1 channel (grayscale image)
        # out_channels=16 specifies the number of output channels or filters
        # kernel_size=5 defines the size of the convolutional kernel (5x5)
        # stride=1 specifies the stride of the convolution operation
        # padding=2 adds padding to the input to ensure that the spatial dimensions remain the same after convolution
        # nn.ReLU() applies the ReLU activation function
        # nn.MaxPool2d performs max pooling with a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2 to downsample the feature maps

        self.conv2 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(16, 32, 5, 1, 2),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2),
        )
        # Define the second convolutional layer (conv2) using nn.Sequential
        # nn.Conv2d creates a 2D convolutional layer
        # The input has 16 channels (output channels from conv1)
        # out_channels=32 specifies the number of output channels or filters
        # kernel_size=5 defines the size of the convolutional kernel (5x5)
        # stride=1 specifies the stride of the convolution operation
        # padding=2 adds padding to the input to ensure that the spatial dimensions remain the same after convolution
        # nn.ReLU() applies the ReLU activation function
        # nn.MaxPool2d performs max pooling with a kernel size of 2 and stride of 2 to downsample the feature maps

        self.out = nn.Linear(32 * 7 * 7, 10)
        # Define the fully connected layer (out) using nn.Linear
        # The input size is 32 * 7 * 7, which is the number of output channels from conv2 multiplied by the spatial dimensions of the feature maps (7x7)
        # The output size is 10, representing the number of classes in the classification task

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        # Perform forward pass through conv1 and conv2

        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        # Flatten the output of conv2 to (batch_size, 32 * 7 * 7)
        # The size of the first dimension (batch_size) remains the same, and the second dimension is flattened

        output = self.out(x)
        # Perform forward pass through the fully connected layer (out) to obtain the output logits

        return output, x
        # Return the output logits and x (flattened feature maps) for visualization purposes


```

## 3. Train the model 

Here, we define a train function which will do the training of the CNN model. 

```python
def train(num_epochs, cnn, loaders):
    # Function to train the CNN model

    from torch.autograd import Variable
    from torch import optim

    # Import necessary modules for training

    optimizer = optim.Adam(cnn.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    # Define the optimizer (Adam) and specify the learning rate
    # Pass the parameters of the CNN model (cnn.parameters()) to the optimizer for optimization

    loss_func = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    # Define the loss function (CrossEntropyLoss) for classification tasks

    cnn.train()
    # Set the model to train mode

    total_step = len(loaders['train'])
    # Calculate the total number of batches in the training data

    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        # Iterate over the specified number of epochs

        for i, (images, labels) in enumerate(loaders['train']):
            # Iterate over the batches of the training data

            b_x = Variable(images)  # batch x
            b_y = Variable(labels)  # batch y

            # Convert the batched input images and labels to Variables
            # Variables are deprecated in recent PyTorch versions and can be replaced with tensors

            output = cnn(b_x)[0]
            # Perform forward pass through the CNN model to obtain the output logits

            loss = loss_func(output, b_y)
            # Compute the loss by comparing the output logits with the ground truth labels

            optimizer.zero_grad()
            # Clear the gradients of the optimizer for this training step

            loss.backward()
            # Perform backpropagation to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters

            optimizer.step()
            # Update the model parameters by applying the computed gradients using the optimizer

            if (i + 1) % 100 == 0:
                # Print the training progress every 100 batches

                print('Epoch [{}/{}], Step [{}/{}], Loss: {:.4f}'
                      .format(epoch + 1, num_epochs, i + 1, total_step, loss.item()))

    PATH = "mnist_trained_model.pt"
    # Specify the file path to save the trained model

    torch.save(cnn.state_dict(), PATH)
    # Save the state dictionary of the CNN model to the specified file path


```

## 4. Define Test function 
  
```python

def test():
    # Function to test the trained model on the test dataset

    # Load the trained model
    PATH = "mnist_trained_model.pt"
    cnn = CNN()
    cnn.load_state_dict(torch.load(PATH))
    cnn.eval()
    # Load the saved state dictionary of the CNN model
    # Set the model to evaluation mode using the eval() method

    # Test the model
    with torch.no_grad():
        # Disable gradient calculation since we are only testing

        correct = 0
        total = 0
        final_accuracy = 0

        total_iterations = len(loaders['test'].dataset.data) / batch_size
        # Calculate the total number of iterations (batches) in the test dataset

        for images, labels in loaders['test']:
            # Iterate over the batches of the test dataset

            test_output, last_layer = cnn(images)
            # Perform forward pass through the CNN model to obtain the test output logits

            pred_y = torch.max(test_output, 1)[1].data.squeeze()
            # Get the predicted labels by finding the maximum value along the second dimension of the test output logits

            accuracy = (pred_y == labels).sum().item() / float(labels.size(0))
            # Compute the accuracy by comparing the predicted labels with the ground truth labels

            final_accuracy += accuracy
            # Accumulate the accuracy for each batch

            print("The current batch accuracy: {}".format(accuracy))

    print("The current accuracy of {} images is {}".format(len(loaders['test'].dataset.data), final_accuracy / total_iterations))
    # Print the overall accuracy of the model on the test dataset


```

Here is how we are going to execute. 

```python
if __name__=="__main__":
    cnn = CNN()
    num_epochs = 10
    # train(num_epochs, cnn, loaders) # This line runs only once. 
    test()

```

Description:

Data Loader :
In this part of the project, the code for loading and pre-processing data is implemented. The original images of handwritten digits (for example, from the MNIST dataset) are loaded and converted into a format suitable for feeding into a neural network. 
Data augmentation can also be applied here to improve communication ability models.

CNN Architecture (Architecture of back neural network):
This part of the project uses a rotational neural network architecture that will be used to classify digits. The architecture may include successive layers of convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. 
The choice of structure affects the typical important features of images and makes accurate predictions.

Training :
In this part of the project, the process of training the spinal neural network is carried out. Here learning parameters are defined such as functional loss (eg categorical cross entropy), optimizer (eg Adam) and learning rate. 
The network is trained on the training data in order to minimize losses and achieve the best performance of the validation data.

Testing :
This part of the project measures the performance of training models on test data that the model has not seen before. Metrics such as accuracy (accuracy) are calculated to understand that a modern good model is able to classify new images of handwritten digits. 
This makes it possible to assess the discussed capability of the model.

Conclusion:
The "Digit Classification" project allows you to apply convolutional neural networks to the problems of classifying handwritten digits. 
It has four main components: data loading, rotational neural network structure, learning process, and performance evaluation. 
The project allows you to study the principles of CNN operation by example, as well as apply them to the definition of classification problems.
